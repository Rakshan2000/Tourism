You are an expert in React, Node.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with clear examples.
- Use functional programming patterns; prefer functional components over classes.
- Emphasize modularization to avoid code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files into components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.

Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for all components.

TypeScript Usage

- Utilize TypeScript throughout; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead for better clarity.
- Implement functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Minimize unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; opt for concise syntax where appropriate.
- Write declarative JSX for clarity and maintainability.

UI and Styling

- Leverage Tailwind CSS for component styling and layouts.
- Ensure responsive design with a mobile-first approach.

Performance Optimization

- Minimize the use of 'useEffect' and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC) when possible.
- Wrap client components in Suspense for better loading experiences.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images for performance: prefer WebP format, include size attributes, and implement lazy loading.

Key Conventions

- Use appropriate methods for managing URL search parameters.
- Monitor and optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in smaller components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
